# SoccerApp

We created a tournament app for table soccer games in our company. We used to this in excel sheets, e-mails, and chats. This app would allow them to manage registrations for tournaments and generate teams based on experience levels.
The development of App based on Microsoft Power Platform, SharePoint, and Power Apps. The Microsoft Power Platform was selected to build the solution as it allows for quick development of applications based on low code to build a user-friendly application covering all needs. The platform was customizable to our requirements, and the development cycles were short and fast, allowing feedback from players to be implemented quickly.

They might begin by creating a registration form that collects information such as the participant's name, email address, and experience level.
Next, we created a dashboard that displays the tournament schedule, team pairings, and results. The dashboard could be designed to update in real-time as results come in, providing an easy way to track the progress of the tournament. We connected automatic notifications via chat and email messages.

To generate teams based on experience level, we used Power Automate to automate the process. For example, we created a workflow that assigns players to teams based on their skill level and ensures that each team has a mix of experienced and inexperienced players.

To make the app more engaging, we added features such as leaderboards, and social sharing options. These features would encourage participants to stay engaged with the tournament and make it more fun overall.
